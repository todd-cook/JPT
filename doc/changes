Changes:
 - implemented 'default' and 'nothing' variables
 - Added tal:evaluate statement.
 - Fixed bug(?) wherein variables used in a tal:repeat would clobber
   their previous values.  Now when a tal:repeat loop finishes the
   previous value of the repeat variable is restored.

New in 0.10.0
 - Integrated the BeanShell.  This allows evaluation of Java expressions 
   and calling of external BeanShell scripts.
 - Structured (xml/html) content is now handled by nekohtml rather
   than Tidy.  Introduced HTMLFragment object which might potentially
   be useful in other apps.

New in 0.9.3

 - Added real namespace support (thank you nekohtml).
 - Added support for arrays.
 - Added bool/cond to bool helper
 - Added date helper.
 - Upgraded metal code to support slots definition and filling across
   multiple layers of macro.
 - Fixed bug with evaluating arrays inside method calls.
 - Added xercesImpl to lib as it is a dependency of nekohtml.  This didn't 
   become a problem until I upgraded to ant 1.6.2.  Previous versions of ant 
   must have included xerces in the classpath.

New in 1.7
 - Migrated build infrastructure to Maven 2, which provides:.
   project reports for Cobertura code coverage, Find Bugs static analysis, Taglists, and Javadocs.
   Maven will also make it easy to test, version and publish any updates to the core libraries.
 - Updated the XML document to use JDOM, updated the StAX parser to use a JDOM developer code.
 - Updated the parser to use Woodstox.
 - Updated the expression language handling to use the MVEL expression language.
 - Updated the logging to use SLF4J - Simple Logging Framework For Java
 - Refactored the PageTemplateImpl example to provide a Builder class to guide users.
 - Updated the units tests to use Junit annotations.
 - Rewrote/arranged the unit tests so they could be more readable & easily referenced
   by someone trying to use JPT.
